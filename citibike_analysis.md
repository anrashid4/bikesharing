# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 


## Population Comparison 

The population of New York City compared to Des Moines is significantly different. New York City is one of the biggest cities in the world and has a population of about 8 million, while Des Moines has a population of about 216,853. This difference is immense and needs to be considered when deciding whether a citi bike program would work in Des Moines. Due to the population being so small compared to NYC, the citi bike program will not have as many customers or subscribers and therefore the business will not profit as much as it does in NYC. 

### Weather Comparison 

The weather for both NYC and Des Moines is rougly about the same around August and so this factor does not play a big role in determining whether Des Moines can benefit from a citi bike program. 

#### Summary 

Overrall, given the statistics and the fact that NYC is so much bigger and more compact than Des Moines, I can conclude that a citi bike program will not work to the same extent in Des Moines as it has in NYC
